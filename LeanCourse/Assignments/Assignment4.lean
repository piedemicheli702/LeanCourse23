Suppose `(A i)_i` is a sequence of sets indexed by a well-ordered type
(this is an order where every nonempty set has a minimum element).
We now define a new sequence by `C n = A n \ (⋃ i < n, A i)`.
In this exercise, we show that the new sequence is pairwise disjoint but has the same union as the
original sequence.

/-- Let's prove that the positive reals form a group under multiplication.
Note: in this exercise `rw` and `simp` will not be that helpful, since the definition is hidden
behind notation. But you can use apply to use the lemmas about real numbers.

Note: any field mentioning `div`, `npow` or `zpow` are fields that you don't have to give when
defining a group. These are operations defined in terms of the group structure. -/

/- Next, we'll prove that if `2 ^ n - 1` is prime, then `n` is prime.
The first exercise is a preparation, and I've given you a skeleton of the proof for the
second exercise. Note how we do some computations in the integers, since the subtraction on `ℕ`
is less well-behaved.
(The converse is not true, because `89 ∣ 2 ^ 11 - 1`) -/
